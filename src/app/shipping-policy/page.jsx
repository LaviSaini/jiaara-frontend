        4. Important Notes for Indian Shipping:
      </h2>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-8 space-y-2 text-gray-700">
        <li>Actively track your parcels to ensure timely delivery.</li>
        <li>
          Ensure someone is available to receive the parcel at the delivery
          address. For non-residential addresses (e.g., offices, hotels),
          customers must coordinate with the relevant collection point or
          courier agency.
        </li>
        <li>
          If no one is available at the delivery address, the courier may not
          make calls. After 1-3 attempts, the parcel will be held at the
          nearest hub. Customers must arrange collection or request
          redelivery. Return-to-sender parcels will incur additional shipping
          costs for reshipment.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fill in the complete delivery address, including the PIN code and
          the correct state, to avoid delays.
